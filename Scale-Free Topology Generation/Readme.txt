The aim of the project is to construct a scale-free network which is known to have ultra-small diameter (~ln ln(n)), where n is the network size. Diameter of a network is defined as the largest shortest path length between all pairs of nodes in the network. The link between two nodes in the network will correspond to a TCP connection. The main task is to find a scalable way of creating TCP connections between nodes using Barabasi-Albert model.
